Artificial Neural Networks(IS664) Course problems solutions.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Exploring the Single Layer Perceptron for classifying logical AND, OR and NOT for 2 inputs (1 for NOT). Uses Sigmoid activation function.

2) Applying Principal Component Analysis(PCA) to a high dimensional data for dimensionality reduction and comparing the performance by applying a classifier.

3) Comparing the performance of K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN) and Support Vector Machine(SVM) classifiers before and after applying Principal Component Analysis(PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

4) Simulating Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) for a simple square matrix.
